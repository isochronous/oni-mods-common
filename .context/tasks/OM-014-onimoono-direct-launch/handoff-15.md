**Store:** `C:/dev/ONI-Mods/common`
**Task scratch:** `C:/dev/ONI-Mods/common/.context/tasks/OM-014-onimoono-direct-launch/` — tracked, write-path exempt, never authoritative ([IF-1.C]).

You are reading this because a coordinator passed you its PATH. It is a file, it stays a file, and you can
re-read it after anything truncates your context. Nothing below was passed to you as a payload.

## 1. Task spec

Source: `.context/tasks/OM-014-onimoono-direct-launch/units/15-review.md`

```
# Unit 15 — review: b01ae19 (failure reason said once; stray-game wording)

## Objective
Confirm commit b01ae19 (manager edit after unit 14) is correct and complete, so the review checkpoint covers the final diff.

## Scope
- IN: `git show b01ae19` in C:\dev\ONI-Mods\common: Invoke-OniTests no longer warns at the catch; the summary prints the failure once (first line in the session line when no status, the rest after it; all lines as "FAILED:" when a status exists); "Moono's log: none written" not printed after a failure that already said so; plain wording in GameProcess.ps1 (Stop-MoonoLaunch stray message), Invoke-OniTests (stray text), Test-OniMods.ps1 (stray wait and 900 s warning: says mods.json holds the test loadout).
- Evidence: a Moono-only run with a stand-in OniMoono that exits 2 printed: "Restored mods.json." / "Runtime: Moono asked; no game log written by this launch" / "Leg failed before the game was found: OniMoono exited with code 2 before the game started." / "Moono wrote no log at …" / exit 2; mods.json unchanged.
- Focus: no failure path now prints nothing (e.g. a failure with a status file, a failure text of one line, the Both side-by-side footer); messages state facts plainly with no hedging.
- OUT: launching anything; touching processes; code changes; commits.
- Acceptance: correct / not, with file:line; findings with severity and expected fix; or "no findings" with the passes run.

## 2. What applies here

The next hop is `ks read`: read the pointer, not the file it sits in.

POINTERS, not contents — ids, one line each, and why each matched. Open what the task needs; the budget was
spent selecting these so yours can be spent reading them.

tags: this brief answered the path question only. A record about a subject rather than a place is reached by `--tag <term>`; the terms are listed by: ks tags --store C:/dev/ONI-Mods/common

⚠ 1 record(s) in this node declare no coverage and no tags and name no source path, so a brief reaches them only when a target or a matched record cites them: tools/TestRunner:tags.md. Give them `applies_to` or tags through the write path.

**Report back, don't write.** You have no write path here — what follows goes back to the coordinator in your report, not into `.context/`. Once you have opened what this work needed: did anything above turn out not to apply once you opened it (nothing above, if nothing was shown)? Did anything that actually governs this work fail to appear here at all — the miss only you can see? Did any pointer's stated one-line reason not match what its record actually says (nothing above, if nothing was shown)?

## 3. Checkpoint contract

**No checkpoints.** The coordinator sized this work at zero deliberately: this unit owes no progress file, because its only deliverable is its report. Zero is a number that was chosen, not a flag that was forgotten.

Write no checkpoint file, and do not invent one under another name — a file this contract does not name is scratch that nothing will read.

Do the work to its end and report. If you cannot finish, your report is what survives this lane: say in it what is done, what is not, and what you would do next.

## 4. Read-beyond licence

This is a strong default, not a cage — read beyond it whenever the task needs it.
