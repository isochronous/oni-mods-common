# Handoff — OM-014-onimoono-direct-launch

**Scope:** `tools/TestRunner/Invoke-OniTests.ps1`, `tools/TestRunner/GameProcess.ps1`, `tools/TestRunner/README.md`, `tools/ModTest/Test-OniMods.ps1`, `tools/ModTest/README.md`
**Store:** `C:/dev/ONI-Mods/common`
**Task scratch:** `C:/dev/ONI-Mods/common/.context/tasks/OM-014-onimoono-direct-launch/` — tracked, write-path exempt, never authoritative ([IF-1.C]).

You are reading this because a coordinator passed you its PATH. It is a file, it stays a file, and you can
re-read it after anything truncates your context. Nothing below was passed to you as a payload.

## 1. Task spec

Source: `.context/tasks/OM-014-onimoono-direct-launch/units/09-review.md`

```
# Unit 09 — review: the fixes after unit 07 (f4656d4^..4c7fad1, i.e. c8d11ae and 4c7fad1)

## Objective
Confirm the commits after the unit 07 review fix every unit 07 finding (M1, M2, m1–m5) and add nothing new, so the review checkpoint covers the final diff.

## Scope
- IN: `git diff 5c65587..4c7fad1 -- tools` in C:\dev\ONI-Mods\common (c8d11ae: `Get-MoonoExitCode`; 4c7fad1: crash watcher excluded from `Get-GameProcess -Any`, `Stop-MoonoLaunch` before the restore, failed Moono leg recorded per leg in Both, `Copy-FreshLog` on the Moono reuse path, wording and cross-references).
- OUT: the rest of the diff (unit 07 covered it); no game or OniMoono launch — Jeremy has OniMoono open; do not touch his processes; change no code.
- Focus beyond the findings: `Stop-MoonoLaunch` must only ever stop processes this launch started (never a Moono Jeremy started by hand); `Get-GameProcess -Any` must still refuse a launch while Jeremy's own game is open.
- Acceptance: per finding fixed / not fixed with file:line; any new finding with severity and expected fix; or "no new findings" with the passes run.

## Context the packet does not carry
- units/07-review-report.md, units/08-implement-report.md.

## Report
- File: .context/tasks/OM-014-onimoono-direct-launch/units/09-review-report.md
- Model tier: default

## 2. What applies here

The next hop is `ks read`: read the pointer, not the file it sits in.

POINTERS, not contents — ids, one line each, and why each matched. Open what the task needs; the budget was
spent selecting these so yours can be spent reading them.

tags: this brief answered the path question only. A record about a subject rather than a place is reached by `--tag <term>`; the terms are listed by: ks tags --store C:/dev/ONI-Mods/common

⚠ 1 record(s) in this node declare no coverage and no tags and name no source path, so a brief reaches them only when a target or a matched record cites them: tools/TestRunner:tags.md. Give them `applies_to` or tags through the write path.

**Report back, don't write.** You have no write path here — what follows goes back to the coordinator in your report, not into `.context/`. Once you have opened what this work needed: did anything above turn out not to apply once you opened it (nothing above, if nothing was shown)? Did anything that actually governs this work fail to appear here at all — the miss only you can see? Did any pointer's stated one-line reason not match what its record actually says (nothing above, if nothing was shown)?

## 3. Checkpoint contract

**No checkpoints.** The coordinator sized this work at zero deliberately: this unit owes no progress file, because its only deliverable is its report. Zero is a number that was chosen, not a flag that was forgotten.

Write no checkpoint file, and do not invent one under another name — a file this contract does not name is scratch that nothing will read.

Do the work to its end and report. If you cannot finish, your report is what survives this lane: say in it what is done, what is not, and what you would do next.

## 4. Read-beyond licence

This is a strong default, not a cage — read beyond it whenever the task needs it.
