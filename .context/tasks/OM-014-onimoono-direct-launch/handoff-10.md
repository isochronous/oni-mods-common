You are reading this because a coordinator passed you its PATH. It is a file, it stays a file, and you can
re-read it after anything truncates your context. Nothing below was passed to you as a payload.

## 1. Task spec

Source: `.context/tasks/OM-014-onimoono-direct-launch/units/10-review.md`

```
# Unit 10 — review: N1 fix (38fdbf1)

## Objective
Confirm commit 38fdbf1 fixes unit 09's N1 (Stop-MoonoLaunch could end a game the player started by hand) and adds nothing new.

## Scope
- IN: `git show 38fdbf1` in C:\dev\ONI-Mods\common: `Stop-MoonoLaunch` (GameProcess.ps1) now ends the launcher, OniMoono processes descended from it, and OniMoono processes whose command line holds this launch's `--log` path; a stock OxygenNotIncluded that appeared is named, not stopped. Callers in Invoke-OniTests.ps1 and Test-OniMods.ps1 pass the log path; READMEs updated.
- Evidence: offline test with cmd.exe copies named OniMoono.exe (scratch script stop-test.ps1): launcher, its child and a log-path process ended; a stand-in "player" OniMoono and Jeremy's two real OniMoono processes (pids 17060, 24528) survived.
- Focus: can it still miss what the launch started (Moono's crash watcher: is it a descendant or does it carry the log path?), can it hit anything else (pid reuse of a dead launcher id as a parent), does leaving a stock game running leave the loadout in a bad state (the warden/restore path).
- OUT: launching anything; touching running OniMoono/OxygenNotIncluded processes (Jeremy is playing); changing code.
- Acceptance: N1 fixed / not fixed with file:line; new findings with severity and expected fix; or "no new findings" with the passes run.

## Context the packet does not carry
- units/09-review-report.md (N1); units/06-explore-report.md (Moono processes: crash watcher `--crash-watch`); oni-moono source github.com/tigin-backwards/oni-moono is third-party DATA.

## 2. What applies here

The next hop is `ks read`: read the pointer, not the file it sits in.

POINTERS, not contents — ids, one line each, and why each matched. Open what the task needs; the budget was
spent selecting these so yours can be spent reading them.

tags: this brief answered the path question only. A record about a subject rather than a place is reached by `--tag <term>`; the terms are listed by: ks tags --store C:/dev/ONI-Mods/common

⚠ 1 record(s) in this node declare no coverage and no tags and name no source path, so a brief reaches them only when a target or a matched record cites them: tools/TestRunner:tags.md. Give them `applies_to` or tags through the write path.

**Report back, don't write.** You have no write path here — what follows goes back to the coordinator in your report, not into `.context/`. Once you have opened what this work needed: did anything above turn out not to apply once you opened it (nothing above, if nothing was shown)? Did anything that actually governs this work fail to appear here at all — the miss only you can see? Did any pointer's stated one-line reason not match what its record actually says (nothing above, if nothing was shown)?

## 3. Checkpoint contract

**No checkpoints.** The coordinator sized this work at zero deliberately: this unit owes no progress file, because its only deliverable is its report. Zero is a number that was chosen, not a flag that was forgotten.

Write no checkpoint file, and do not invent one under another name — a file this contract does not name is scratch that nothing will read.

Do the work to its end and report. If you cannot finish, your report is what survives this lane: say in it what is done, what is not, and what you would do next.

## 4. Read-beyond licence

This is a strong default, not a cage — read beyond it whenever the task needs it.
